Todo:
* Profiling
* Resizing behavior
* Shadow behavior
* Dragging as a behavior of the control
* Connections from a back to something else is blowing up ... I get some weird behavior
* Connecting is a bit glitchy.
* Connecting is also a question of semantics: I get some behavior thqt looks good but isn't. 
* I Want lots of visual feedbvack ... selected item ... movable items. Stuff!

Notes: April 11th
Performance seems good enough.

To-do:
* Convert to JavaScript. 
* Get Plato math library working 
* Plato math benchmarks 
* Text editor
* Would be nice if additional state could be stored in a control. 
* Double click to open. 
* A "Random"
* Use the theme as a graph. 
* Figure out what the compound nodes look like
* WHere do the edit controls go? 
* If I double click a slot it should open up, but what if its a number ... maybe then it becomesan edit box? If there is an edit box, 
then the input slot would disappear. 
* What about if there are multiple inputs. 
* SO: double click a node and it opens up into new 
* How do I go back? 
* Connecting to a value that has been "edited", would erase the value.
	* Is there an "up" mode? Does it delete the old value. 
* I could start by creating an "edit" box node? In a way that solve the problem. 
	* Slide out to the left the edit box. 
* Double clicking shows an edit box to the left. 
* I want to draw the while loop (for-loop / until-loop as well?) 
	* I have to find my notes .
* Talk to Inigo Quienez about Emu
	* Beecome his patreon.
* Figure out the Strange Loop talk
* Do something agbout all of the nested with statements. 
* Plato math bookmarks 
* I want Plato to add "With" functions automatically for the types in its repo. 
* I want to port the math and then the geometry library to JavaScript. I can just get a basic test to work.
* How am I going to get the whole Peacock system translated to efficient JavaScript? THis seems like it is going to be a TON of work.
	* BUT ... if it works, wow. 
* I kind of want every control to have its own behavior. 
	* Makes me wonder if I even need Process Input on a control? They don't do anything!
