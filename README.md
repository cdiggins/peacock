# Peacock

A Cross-Platform Functional UI Library written in C#

# Why?

There is no good cross-platform UI library in C#.

WPF is a pretty good library.

Some areas for improvement:

* Run on other platforms (e.g. Web)
* Simpler layout mechanism
* More efficient
* Less dependency on INPC
* Not based on a mutable paradigm
* Better tooling support 
* Not have separate languages (C# + XAML + Binding sub-language)
* Easier to extend
* Easier to learn
